== How to build and install

In order to build, you need development tools for the Go programming
language ("apt-get install golang" on Debian).
        $ make
        # make install


== How to run a relay

You will need a version of Tor supporting the extended OR port protocol.
Git master as of 15 August, 2013 works.

        $ git clone https://git.torproject.org/tor.git

Add configuration like the following to the relay's torrc. You can
change the --port option; make sure that port is open in the firewall.

        ExtORPort auto
        ServerTransportPlugin websocket exec /usr/local/bin/websocket-server --port 9901
